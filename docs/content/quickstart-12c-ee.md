# El Carro Operator installation guide - Oracle 12c EE

El Carro is a new tool that allows users to keep full control of their database
environment (root on a machine, sysdba in Oracle), while helping users automate
several aspects of managing their database services.

El Carro helps you with the deployment and management of a database software
(like Oracle database) on Kubernetes. You must have appropriate licensing rights
to that database software to allow you to use it with El Carro (BYOL).

This quickstart aims to help get your licensed Oracle 12c EE database up and
running on Kubernetes. This guide is only intended for users that have a valid
license for Oracle 12c EE. If you do not have a license, you should use Oracle
18c XE which is free to use by following the
[quickstart guide for Oracle 18c XE](quickstart-18c-xe.md) instead. If instead,
you have a license for Oracle 19c EE, check out the
[quickstart guide for Oracle 19c EE](quickstart-19c-ee.md)

## Before you begin

The following variables will be used in this quickstart:

```sh
export DBNAME=<Must consist of only uppercase letters, and digits. For example: MYDB>
export PROJECT_ID=<your GCP project id>
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID=<The ID for the service account to be used by El Carro>
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT=<fully qualified name of the compute service account to be used by El Carro (i.e. SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com)>
export PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE=<the complete path to the downloaded release directory>
export GCS_BUCKET=<your globally unique Google Cloud Storage bucket name>
export ZONE=<for example: us-central1-a>
export CLUSTER_NAME=<for example: cluster1>
```

You should set these variables in your environment.

Download El Carro software to your workstation as follows:

1) Option 1: You can download it from
   [El Carro GitHub repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/elcarro-oracle-operator/releases).
   Choose one of the release versions, preferably the latest release. The release
   artifacts exist as *release-artifacts.tar.gz*.

2) Option 2: You can choose one of the release versions, preferably the latest
   release, from this
   [GCS bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/elcarro) using
   [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil).

```sh
gsutil -m cp -r gs://elcarro/latest $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE
```

[Create a new GCP project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
or reuse an existing one to install El Carro. GCP provides
[free tier products](https://cloud.google.com/free). So if you are not already a
GCP user, you can sign up for a free trial. :)

```sh
gcloud projects create $PROJECT_ID [--folder [...]]
```

Set gcloud config project to $PROJECT_ID `sh gcloud config set project
$PROJECT_ID`

Check gcloud config project `sh gcloud config get-value project`

Create a new service account or reuse an existing one in your GCP project to
install El Carro. Check out
[Creating and Managing Service Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts)
if you need help creating or locating an existing service account.

To get El Carro up and running, you need to do one of the following:

**Express install**

Download required Oracle Database 12c software and upload the files to your
*$GCS_BUCKET*

-   Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2.0.1.0) for Linux x86-64 (Enterprise
    Edition), which can be downloaded from the
    [Oracle eDelivery Cloud](https://edelivery.oracle.com).
-   A recent PSU. The October 2020 PSU can be downloaded
    [here](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/PatchDetail?_adf.ctrl-state=1u1jba74q_4&patch_name=31741641&releaseId=600000000018520&patchId=31741641&languageId=0&platformId=226&_afrLoop=487591712579046).
-   Latest available OPatch that can be downloaded from
    [here](https://updates.oracle.com/download/6880880.html). We recommend
    choosing the following download parameters:
    -   Release: OPatch 20.0.0.0.0
    -   Platform: Linux x86_64

Run the express installation script:

```sh
$PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/deploy/install.sh --db_version 12.2 --gcs_oracle_binaries_path $GCS_BUCKET --service_account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```

Optionally set CDB name, GKE cluster name, GKE zone

```sh
$PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/deploy/install.sh --db_version 12.2 --gcs_oracle_binaries_path $GCS_BUCKET --service_account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT --cdb_name $DBNAME --cluster_name $CLUSTER_NAME --gke_zone $ZONE
```

OR

**Perform the manual installation steps:**

*   Check downloaded El Carro software
*   Create a containerized database image
*   Provision a kubernetes cluster. We recommend a cluster running
    Kubernetes/GKE version 1.17 or above.
*   Deploy the El Carro Operator to your Kubernetes cluster
*   Create an Instance (CDB) and Database (PDB) via the El Carro Operator

## Check downloaded El Carro software

El Carro software was downloaded to $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE, artifacts:

*   The `operator.yaml` is a collection of manifests that is used to deploy the
    El Carro Operator:
*   The `ui.yaml` is a collection of manifests that is used to deploy the El
    Carro UI.
*   The `dbimage` directory contains a set of files for building a containerized
    database image described in the next section.
*   The `samples` directory contains the manifests for creating Custom Resources
    (CRs) mentioned in this user guide.
*   The `workflows` directory is similar to samples, but the manifests there are
    the DRY templates that can be hydrated with
    [kpt](https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/) to create/manage the same
    Custom Resources (CRs).

We recommend starting with the samples first, but as you become more familiar
with El Carro, consider the more advanced use of declarative workflows that can
be achieved with the parameterized templates in the workflows directory.

The `db_monitor.yaml` and `setup_monitoring.sh` files are useful to deploy the
El Carro monitoring and viewing metrics.

## Procuring a containerized Oracle database image

There are 3 options to procure a 12c EE database image:

-   **Option 1**: Using Google Cloud Build to create a containerized Oracle
    database image via El Carro image build scripts
-   **Option 2**: Building a containerized Oracle database image locally using
    Docker via El Carro image build scripts
-   **Option 3:** Downloading database installation files and create your
    database image using
    [scripts](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance)
    supplied by Oracle

Each of these options is described in more details below.

Currently, only options 1 and 2 allow you to build a seeded image. Seeded images
come with a pre-created CDB. This can drastically cut down provisioning time
since El Carro will not need to create a CDB, which can be time consuming.
Additionally, only options 1 and 2 allow you to patch your database software
during image build, ensuring you are running the latest and greatest software.

If you choose to follow option 1 or 2 you will need to download three pieces of
software from Oracle's website:

-   Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2.0.1.0) for Linux x86-64 (Enterprise
    Edition), which can be downloaded from the
    [Oracle eDelivery Cloud](https://edelivery.oracle.com).
-   A recent PSU. The October 2020 PSU can be downloaded
    [here](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/PatchDetail?_adf.ctrl-state=1u1jba74q_4&patch_name=31741641&releaseId=600000000018520&patchId=31741641&languageId=0&platformId=226&_afrLoop=487591712579046).
-   Latest available OPatch that can be downloaded from
    [here](https://updates.oracle.com/download/6880880.html). We recommend
    choosing the following download parameters:
    -   Release: OPatch 20.0.0.0.0
    -   Platform: Linux x86_64

There are two options to build the actual container database image: Using Google
Cloud Build or building the image locally using Docker.

### Option 1: Using Google Cloud Build to create a containerized Oracle database image (Recommended)

1.  [Create a new GCP project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
    or reuse an existing one with the following settings:

    ```sh
    gcloud projects create $PROJECT_ID [--folder [...]]
    gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com anthos.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com --project $PROJECT_ID
    ```

    Though the default compute service account can be used with El Carro, we
    recommend creating a dedicated one as follows:

    ```sh
    gcloud iam service-accounts create $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID --project $PROJECT_ID
    export PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format="value(projectNumber)")
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member=serviceAccount:service-${PROJECT_NUMBER}@containerregistry.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/containerregistry.ServiceAgent
    ```

2.  Transfer the Oracle binaries you downloaded earlier to a
    [GCS bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage). If needed, a new GCS bucket
    can be created as follows:

    ```sh
    gsutil mb gs://$GCS_BUCKET

    gsutil cp ~/Downloads/V839960-01.zip gs://$GCS_BUCKET/install/
    gsutil cp ~/Downloads/p6880880_200000_Linux-x86-64.zip  gs://$GCS_BUCKET/install/
    gsutil cp ~/Downloads/p32228578_122010_Linux-x86-64.zip  gs://$GCS_BUCKET/install/
    ```

    Once the bucket is ready, grant the IAM read privilege
    (roles/storage.objectViewer) to the Google Cloud Build service account. Use
    your project name as a PROJECT_ID and your globally unique GCS bucket name
    in the snippet below:

    ```sh
    export PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format="value(projectNumber)")
    gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com:roles/storage.objectViewer gs://$GCS_BUCKET
    ```

3.  Trigger the Google Cloud Build pipeline

    You have the choice of creating a container image with just the Oracle RDBMS
    software in it or, optionally, create a seed database (CDB) at the same time
    and host it in the same container image. Seeded images are larger in size
    but may save you time during provisioning. For a quick start, we suggest you
    create a seeded container image.

    -   To create a seeded image, run the following:

    ```sh
    cd $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/dbimage
    chmod +x ./image_build.sh

    ./image_build.sh --install_path=gs://$GCS_BUCKET/install --db_version=12.2 --PATCH_VERSION=32228578 --create_cdb=true --cdb_name=$DBNAME --mem_pct=45 --no_dry_run --project_id=$PROJECT_ID

    Executing the following command:
    [...]
    ```

    If **AccessDeniedException** is raised against the above command, it's
    likely because the previous `gsutil iam ch` command didn’t succeed. We
    suggest you rerun the `gsutil` command and ensure that the Cloud build
    service account has the read privilege on the GCS bucket that contains the
    Oracle software.

    -   To create an unseeded image (one without a CDB), run the same steps as
        for the seeded case but set the `--create_cdb` flag to `false` and omit
        the `--cdb_name` parameter.

    ```sh
    cd $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/dbimage
    chmod +x ./image_build.sh

    ./image_build.sh --install_path=gs://$GCS_BUCKET/install --db_version=12.2 --PATCH_VERSION=32228578 --create_cdb=false --mem_pct=45 --no_dry_run --project_id=$PROJECT_ID

    Executing the following command:
    [...]
    ```

4.  Verify that your containerized database image was successfully created.

    Depending on the options you choose when you run the image creation script,
    creating a containerized image may take ~40+ minutes. To verify the image
    that was created, run:

    ```sh
    gcloud container images list --project $PROJECT_ID --repository gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/oracle-database-images

    NAME
    gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/oracle-database-images/oracle-12.2-ee-seeded-$DBNAME

    gcloud container images describe gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/oracle-database-images/oracle-12.2-ee-seeded-$DBNAME

    image_summary:
      digest: sha256:ce9b44ccab513101f51516aafea782dc86749a08d02a20232f78156fd4f8a52c
      fully_qualified_digest: gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/oracle-database-images/oracle-12.2-ee-database-$DBNAME@sha256:ce9b44ccab513101f51516aafea782dc86749a08d02a20232f78156fd4f8a52c
      registry: gcr.io
      repository: $PROJECT_ID/oracle-database-images/oracle-12.2-ee-database-$DBNAME
    ```

### Option 2: Building a containerized Oracle database image locally using Docker

If you're not able or prefer not to use Google cloud build to create a
containerized database image, you can build an image locally using
[Docker](https://www.docker.com). You need to push your locally built image to a
registry that your Kubernetes cluster can pull images from. You must have Docker
installed before proceeding with a local containerized database image build.

Note that in the current release, local build only works with Linux systems.
Additional support for other operating systems like Windows, Mac OS, etc. will
be added in future releases.

1.  Copy the Oracle binaries you downloaded earlier to
    `PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/dbimage`

    Your $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE directory should look something like.

    ```sh
    ls -1X
    Dockerfile
    README.md
    image_build.sh
    install-oracle-18c-xe.sh
    install-oracle.sh
    ora12-config.sh
    ora19-config.sh
    cloudbuild.yaml
    p32228578_122010_Linux-x86-64.zip
    p6880880_200000_Linux-x86-64.zip
    V839960-01.zip
    ```

2.  Trigger the image creation script

    You have the choice of creating a container image with just the Oracle RDBMS
    software in it or, optionally, create a seed database (CDB) at the same time
    and host it in the same container image. Seeded images are larger in size
    but may save you time during provisioning. For a quick start, we suggest you
    create a seeded container image.

    -   To create a seeded image, run the following:

    ```sh
    cd $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/dbimage
    chmod +x ./image_build.sh

    ./image_build.sh --local_build=true --db_version=12.2 --patch_version=32228578 --create_cdb=true --cdb_name=$DBNAME --mem_pct=45 --no_dry_run --project_id=local-build

    Executing the following command:
    [...]
    ```

    -   To create an unseeded image (one without a CDB), run the same steps as
        for the seeded case but set the `--create_cdb` flag to `false` and omit
        the `--cdb_name` parameter.

    ```sh
    cd $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/dbimage
    chmod +x ./image_build.sh

    ./image_build.sh --local_build=true --db_version=12.2 --patch_version=32228578 --create_cdb=false --mem_pct=45 --no_dry_run --project_id=local-build

    Executing the following command:
    [...]
    ```

3.  Verify that your containerized database image was successfully created

    Depending on the options you choose when you run the image creation script,
    creating a containerized image may take ~40+ minutes. To verify that your
    image was successfully created, run the following command:

    ```sh
    docker images
    REPOSITORY                                                                               TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
    gcr.io/local-build/oracle-database-images/oracle-12.2-ee-seeded-$DBNAME        latest    c766d980c9a0   2 hours ago   12.9GB
    ```

4.  Re-tag your locally built image if necessary using the
    [docker tag command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/)
    and push it to a registry that your Kubernetes cluster can pull images from
    using the
    [docker push command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/).

### Option 3: Create your database image using scripts supplied by Oracle

1.  Follow instructions posted on Oracle's
    [GitHub repo](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance)
2.  Re-tag your locally built image if necessary using the
    [docker tag command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/)
    and push it to a registry that your Kubernetes cluster can pull images from
    using the
    [docker push command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/).

    Note that any image built using Oracle's scripts will be unseeded, meaning
    it won't contain a CDB. As such, El Carro will automatically create a CDB
    during instance provisioning.

## Provisioning a Kubernetes cluster on GKE to run El Carro

To provision a Kubernetes cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), run the
following command:

```sh
gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME --release-channel rapid --machine-type=n1-standard-4 --num-nodes 2 --zone $ZONE --project $PROJECT_ID --scopes gke-default,compute-rw,cloud-platform,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/dataaccessauditlogging --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```

To get the cluster ready for El Carro, create a k8s storage class and a volume
snapshot class as follows:

```sh
kubectl create -f $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/deploy/csi/gce_pd_storage_class.yaml
kubectl create -f $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/deploy/csi/gce_pd_volume_snapshot_class.yaml
```

Verify that both resources have been created properly by running:

```sh
kubectl get storageclasses
NAME                 PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
csi-gce-pd           pd.csi.storage.gke.io   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  30d
standard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd    Delete          Immediate              true                   30d

kubectl get volumesnapshotclass
NAME                        AGE
csi-gce-pd-snapshot-class   78s
```

## Deploying the El Carro Operator to a Kubernetes cluster

You can use `kubectl` to deploy the El Carro Operator to your cluster by
running:

```sh
kubectl apply -f $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/operator.yaml
namespace/operator-system created
[...]
```

## Creating an El Carro Instance

To create an instance:

-   Create a namespace to host your instance by running:

    ```sh
    kubectl create namespace db
    ```

-   Modify
    $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/samples/v1alpha1_instance_custom_seeded.yaml to
    include the link to the database service image you built earlier.

-   Apply the modified yaml file by running:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/samples/v1alpha1_instance_custom_seeded.yaml -n db
    ```

Monitor creation of your instance by running:

```sh
kubectl get -w instances.oracle.db.anthosapis.com -n db

NAME   DB ENGINE   VERSION   EDITION      ENDPOINT      URL                DB NAMES   BACKUP ID   READYSTATUS   READYREASON        DBREADYSTATUS   DBREADYREASON
mydb   Oracle      12.2      Enterprise   mydb-svc.db   34.71.69.25:6021                          False         CreateInProgress
```

Once your instance is ready, the **READYSTATUS** and **DBREADYSTATUS** will both
flip to **TRUE**.

Tip: You can monitor the logs from the El Carro operator by running:

```sh
kubectl logs -l control-plane=controller-manager -n operator-system -c manager -f
```

## Creating a PDB (Database)

To store and query data, create a PDB and attach it to the instance you created
in the previous step by running:

```sh
kubectl apply -f $PATH_TO_EL_CARRO_RELEASE/samples/v1alpha1_database_pdb1.yaml -n db
```

Monitor creation of your PDB by running:

```sh
kubectl get -w databases.oracle.db.anthosapis.com -n db
NAME   INSTANCE   USERS                                 PHASE   DATABASEREADYSTATUS   DATABASEREADYREASON   USERREADYSTATUS   USERREADYREASON
pdb1   mydb       ["superuser","scott","proberuser"]    Ready   True                  CreateComplete        True              SyncComplete
```

Once your PDB is ready, the **DATABASEREADYSTATUS** and **USERREADYSTATUS** will
both flip to **TRUE**.

You can access your PDB externally by using
[sqlplus](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQPUG/toc.htm):

```sh
sqlplus scott/tiger@$INSTANCE_URL/pdb1.gke
```

Replace $INSTANCE_URL with the URL that was assigned to your instance.
